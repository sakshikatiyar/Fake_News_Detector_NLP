#  Fake News Classifier using NLP and Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model that classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It was built as a beginner-friendly end-to-end notebook project to explore data cleaning, vectorization, model training, and evaluation.

##  Project Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix
- End-to-end code in a single Colab notebook

##  Open in Google Colab

> Replace `your-username`, `your-repo-name`, and `your-notebook-name.ipynb` with your actual GitHub details.

##  Dataset

The dataset used was the **Fake and Real News Dataset**, which includes labeled news articles. You can find it here:

[ Kaggle Dataset – Fake and Real News](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

## ⚙ Requirements

This project runs on Google Colab, so you don’t need to install anything locally. All required libraries are pre-installed in Colab:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

##  Output Example

- Accuracy: ~92–95%
- Confusion Matrix showing TP, TN, FP, FN
- Cleaned plots of class distribution
